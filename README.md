# What API did you use, link to the API
We used a Maryland database that lists all the hospitals along with their address and respective information. The json file initially shows all hospitals in the US, but we specified MD hospitals only for our project
https://www.communitybenefitinsight.org/?page=info.data_api </h2>

# What visualizations does your project drive?
-The map allows for us to set markers to each hospital in the city and click on them to see the names of each marker. 
-A list is also made when click on the drop down menu to view all of the cities in MD. 
-The buttons are usable and visible to the user and we styled the page with css to make it aesthetic. 

# What visualization or other JS libraries does your project use?
-We used leaflet for our map input and other designs for boxes/containers etc.
-We also used OpenCage Geocoder for our live map visual and markers. 
-Fetch API requests

# What CSS frameworks did you use? What version of them?

# What is your actual project trying to display and solve?
Our actual project is attempting to make it faster and easier to search for and locate any hospital in any city in Maryland. The dropdown menu was key to this so that users donâ€™t have to worry about typos and can quickly choose an option
